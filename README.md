summer-chores

Kate has a list of summer chores they have to do every Saturday. There are a lot of chores for them to do and naturally get more tired throughout completing their tasks. If they get too tired, they may fall asleep before completing all their chores.

They have a strict routine, which follows in order:

    Mowing the yard
    Weedeating the edges of the house and fence line
    Trimming the hedges
    Collect fallen wood for summer night fires
    Water the garden

If they manage not to get tired and fall asleep while doing their chores, they have successfully completed their chores. 

callbackVersion.js uses call backs to complete tasks
promiseVersion.js uses promises to complete tasks
